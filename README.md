# wine_mp3tag

  
Mp3Tag wine installation.  
  
This is a Mp3Tag (x64+32) installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
Depending of your cpu architecture, the 64bits or 32bits version will be installed (in a .win64 or .win32 prefix)  
This installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian based distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop file).  
  
Instructions:  
  
clone the repository, an cd to the wine_mp3tag folder  
set install_mp3tag.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_mp3tag.sh  
launch the installer: ./install_mp3tag.sh  
  
Enjoy.
